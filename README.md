## üé® Color System

GeoCruze uses a bold yet minimal color palette designed to balance modern cleanliness with energetic branding.

### ‚úÖ Color & Typography Palette

| Purpose               | Value             | Hex Code / Font      | Usage                                                     |
|-----------------------|-------------------|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Background**        | White             | `#FFFFFF`            | Clean page backdrop                                      |
| **Primary Text**      | Black / Grey      | `#000000` / `#333333`| High readability                                         |
| **Accent / Brand**    | Orange            | `#FF6B00`            | Logo, buttons, headings                                  |
| **Image Backgrounds** | Coral Red         | `#FF4040`            | Used behind product images for visual impact             |
| **Typography**        | Ubuntu / Varino   | *Font Family*        | Ubuntu for body text, Varino for headers and branding    |

### üéØ Rationale

- **Clarity & Space**: White background keeps the content clean and dominant.
- **Brand Energy**: Orange and Coral Red inject vibrancy and a sporty personality.
- **Contrast in Imagery**: Coral Red makes bike and lifestyle images pop.
- **Typography Focus**: *Varino* (display) + *Ubuntu* (body) balance style and readability.

## üì± Breakpoint Logic

GeoCruze adjusts to all screen sizes via responsive font scaling and layout shifts.

| Breakpoint (max-width) | Font Scaling (%) | Responsive Behavior                                      |
|------------------------|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| 1500px                 | 62.5%            | Base layout and font scale                               |
| 1250px                 | 50%              | Adjusts for medium-sized screens                         |
| 1050px                 | 43%              | More compact layout and typography                       |
| 920px                  | 35%              | Layout stacks vertically, mobile transition begins       |
| 720px                  | 35%              | Hero section shrinks, nav icon replaces full menu        |

## üß™ Creative Divergences from Mockup

Several enhancements were added to strengthen brand identity and improve performance:

- **Custom Font Integration**: *Varino* embedded for bold, adventurous identity.
- **Mobile Navigation**: Transforms into a flex-based menu with a custom icon.
-  **Modern Bike Imagery**: We incorporated high-quality, modern images of bikes to align with current design aesthetics and appeal to today‚Äôs adventurous riders.
- **Image Styling**: Coral Red (`#FF4040`) used as dynamic backgrounds for visuals.
